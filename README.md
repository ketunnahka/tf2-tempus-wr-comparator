TF2 Tempus WR Comparator

https://ketunnahka.github.io/tf2-tempus-wr-comparator/

This tool is pretty simple and straightforward: copy a video URL from Tempus Archive YT channel, and paste it through the top box.

You can also compare current WR with older WRs (not the most recent one that will automatically show up) by putting the old WR URL into the lower box (it will replace the video player on the right side) i.e. you can take a Tempus Archive WR and compare it to Tempus Records old WR, although I'm not sure if the -3 second offset is identical (that's for the second button).
